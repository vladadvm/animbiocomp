                        <p class="paragraph">Evaluation of new biomaterials as innovative approach to substitute or upgrade structural components of the organism requires multidisciplinary approach of veterinarians and doctors. Adequate animal model for evaluation of its compatibility in order to estimate risks and advantages in humans is required. The aim of project is to train and enable Serbian scientists to create animal models for evaluation of biomaterials compatibility with experience and supervision of the expert from diaspora.</p>

                                The researchers from Serbian SRO will be trained at Host institution to design and implement experiments on domestic animals used as models in biomaterials compatibility estimating in preclinical scientific researches.
                                Besides learning the basic principles of working with different species of animals and planning the experiments, the Serbian team will be introduced to the up-to-date methodology used in current research in biomaterials used in surgical procedures. Researchers from SRO will learn how to perform surgical procedures and postoperative monitoring of the animals with biomaterials implants. Also, molecular techniques on tissue acquired from different species of domestic animals will be tested. As overall result of activity 1. staff from Serbian SRO will be trained for conducting biomaterials compatibility experiments on laboratory and conventionally raised animals (pigs and sheep).

Registration will be conducted at the Serbian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy. The “Experimental facility for conventionally raised animals (pigs and sheep)” will be adopted in consultation with expert from diaspora in accordance with 3R Directive 63/2010EU and good practice in the Host institution.

After every training at the Host institution, report containing photographs will be published at the website. The key result of activity 3. will be the promotion of the newly established “Experimental facility for conventionally raised animals” to scientific public. This should lead to recognition of Serbian SRO as unique center for biomaterials compatibility experiments on pigs and sheep in the region.

                        The main objective of this project is to improve the scientific cooperation with the Diaspora and support Serbian scientists in creating animal models for evaluation of biomaterials compatibility. Scientists from Serbia, veterinarians, will be able to support medical research in the field of biomaterials compatibility as it is practiced in the Host institution. As a result of cooperation young researchers from SRO – histologists, physiologists and veterinary surgeons, should work together and cover all necessary fields in biomaterial compatibility research meaning surgical implantation and postoperative care, metabolic, endocrine and health estimation of domestic animals used as models, and tissue response to biomaterials, thus providing good service to human scientists. With supervision of the expert from diaspora, the Serbian team will be trained to support medical scientists from different fields to choose animal models for biomaterial compatibility estimation, and conduct experiment on domestic animals. 
                        Up to date SRO from Serbia has two registered facilities for laboratory animals (rats, mice and rabbits). Nevertheless, SRO from Serbia does not have a facility for conventionally raised domestic animals (pigs and sheep). Conventionally raised animals (pigs and sheep) are used as animal models for evaluation of biomaterials compatibility at the Host institution. The aim of the project is to establish a new “Experimental facility for conventionally raised domestic animals (pigs and sheep)” at Serbian SRO. Registration will be conducted at the Serbian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy. The “Experimental facility for conventionally raised animals (pigs and sheep)” will be adopted in consultation with expert from diaspora in accordance with 3R Directive 63/2010EU and good practice in the Host institution. Serbian SRO will finance the adaptation of Experimental facility (one room for pigs and one for sheep) as strong contribution to the project implementation.
